CHANGES

  Version 0.9.1

    - Structures are now converted to Numpy recarrays

    - Removed dependency on intrinsic bin() function, which
      caused the module to only be compatible with Python 2.6

    - Variable names are now case-insensitive

    - Variables can now be access as attributes, e.g.:
        s.variable_name

    - Recarray fields can be accessed in lowercase, e.g.:
        s.variable_name.field_name

  Version 0.9.0
