CHANGES

  Version 0.9.6

    This version is identical to the initial version committed to scipy.io.idl

    - Added unit tests

    - Scalars are now returned with the correct Numpy type

    - The read() function now returns a case-insensitive dictionary of
      variables with attribute access

    - Added option to provide an existing dictionary to append variables to

    - Re-released under MIT license

  Version 0.9.5

    - Added support for reading .sav files written with /COMPRESS

  Version 0.9.4

  Version 0.9.3

    - Implemented IDL pointers

  Version 0.9.2

    - Fixed reading in of byte scalars and arrays

  Version 0.9.1

    - Structures are now converted to Numpy recarrays

    - Removed dependency on intrinsic bin() function, which
      caused the module to only be compatible with Python 2.6

    - Variable names are now case-insensitive

    - Variables can now be access as attributes, e.g.:
        s.variable_name

    - Recarray fields can be accessed in lowercase, e.g.:
        s.variable_name.field_name
